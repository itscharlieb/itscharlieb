I'm a software developer and entrepreneur. I like building and reading all things software and have been doing so since I started my undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2013. This site is an attempt to do two things:

1. Document my personal and professional projects in the tech world.
2. Act as a place for me to spew my thoughts on technology, in the form of a blog.
